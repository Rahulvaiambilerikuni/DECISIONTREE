# DECISIONTREE
A decision tree is a popular machine learning model used for both classification and regression tasks. Itâ€™s a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature (input variable), each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents the final prediction or class label (for classification) or numerical value (for regression).
